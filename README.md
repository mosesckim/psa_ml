## Environment

Create a new environment using `virtualenv` or `conda`. Make sure `pip` is pointing to the correct path (i.e. inside your environment) by running `which pip`.

## Install package (CLI)

Once you have created your environment activate it and `cd` into the project repository root and run:

    pip install .


The command above will install necessary dependencies and packages found inside `bl_rec/` and `ontime/`.
